# husort
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/brianloveswords/husort.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/brianloveswords/husort)

Numerically sort lines that start with human-readable file sizes, e.g. "32.3G ./Movies"

# Install
```bash
$ npm install -g husort
```

# Usage

## CLI

```bash
$ du -h /path/ | husort
```

Options:
* `-r | --reverse`: reverse the order of the sorting.

## Library

### husort(array)

Sort an array of strings where each entry is prefixed by (potentially)
human readable file sizes.

## Why not just use `sort -h`

Because when I wrote this I didn't realize `sort -h` was possible â€“ the
native OS X `sort` doesn't have that option. It turns out you can get a
version that does, though:

```bash
$ brew install coreutils
$ brew link coreutils
$ # now you have a `gsort` bin that supports -h
```

I'll still leave this library/repo kicking around because the library
itself might be useful to someone

(Thanks to [@mrtazz](https://twitter.com/mrtazz), who pointed out the
existence of `sort -h`)
